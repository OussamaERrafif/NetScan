# NetScan

NetScan is an advanced network scanning tool developed in Python, designed to provide comprehensive insights into network devices and services. It incorporates cutting-edge techniques and features for efficient and thorough network reconnaissance.

## Features

### 1. Advanced Scanning Techniques
- **Service Detection:** Identify running services and their versions on open ports.
- **Operating System Detection:** Determine the operating system of detected devices.
- **Traceroute:** Trace the path packets take to reach target devices.
- **Banner Grabbing:** Gather service banners for detailed information.

### 2. Parallel and Asynchronous Scanning (under development)
- **Multithreading or Asynchronous I/O:** Implement parallel scanning for faster results.
- **Rate Limiting:** Control scanning rates to avoid network congestion or detection.

### 3. Customizable Scan Profiles (under development)
- **Preset Profiles:** Quick, full, stealth scans for user convenience.
- **Custom Profiles:** Define and save custom scanning parameters.

### 4. Security Features (under development)
- **Detection Evasion:** Techniques to evade firewalls and IDS.
- **Encrypted Communication:** Secure scanner-target communications.

### 5. Integration with Other Tools (under development)
- **Vulnerability Databases:** Integrate with CVE and other databases.
- **Export Formats:** Support JSON, XML, and CSV for compatibility.

### 6. User-Friendly Interface (under development)
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Optional GUI for ease of use.
- **Web Interface:** Access and control via Flask or Django.

### 7. Visualization and Reporting (under development)
- **Interactive Network Map:** Visualize network topology.
- **Detailed Reports:** Comprehensive, filterable reports.
- **Real-Time Updates:** Monitor scan progress and results.

### 8. Additional Protocol Support (under development)
- **IPv6 Support:** Extend scanning capabilities to IPv6.
- **SNMP Scanning:** Gather detailed info from network devices.

### 9. Automation and Scripting (under development)
- **Scheduling Scans:** Automated scans at specified times.
- **Scripting Interface:** API for advanced automation.

### 10. Machine Learning and AI (under development)
- **Anomaly Detection:** ML for detecting network anomalies.
- **Predictive Analysis:** AI-based threat predictions.
